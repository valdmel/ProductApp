# Products CRUD Application v2.0
 
A basic products CRUD application where you can register produts of all kinds. I created it when I was studying Angular and Angular Material. Developed with Angular 8 and Spring 5.

## Installation Guide
- Go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download the LTS version
- You're done! Angular CLI is installed! :)

## Angular application initialization
- Open Node.js command prompt and go to the project folder
- Type "npm install" to install all dependencies
- Type "npm install bootstrap --save" to install Bootstrap
- Type "ng add @angular/material" to install Angular Material
- After downloading all dependencies, use the command "ng serve --open" or "ng s --o" to start the application
- You're done! The application will start on http://localhost:4200 :)

## Spring application initialization
- Open the project in any IDE with Java support and click on Run
